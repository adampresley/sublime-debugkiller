			<hr />

			<p>
				In the section titled <a href="global-config.html">Global Config</a> we talked about how
				to configure patterns for the plugin to identify based on the <strong>scope</strong> of
				the current file being edited. In this section we'll talk about how you can also
				add patterns at the project level.
			</p>

			<p>
				At times it might be desirable to have the Debug Killer plugin look for certain patterns
				based on what 
				<a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/file_management/file_management.html#projects" target="_blank">Sublime project</a> 
				you are working on. This is useful is many ways. For example you may be working on a project
				that uses a specific framework that has special logging functions. You may want Debug Killer
				to look for these logging functions while only working in this project.
			</p>

			<br />
			<h2>Example</h2>

			<p>
				Let's pretend we have a project open and we want to add a check for the debug framework method called
				<strong>debugMe()</strong>. Here's how. First in Sublime click the <em>Project</em> menu and selected 
				<em>Edit Project</em></li>. You should see something that looks like this:
			</p>

<pre class="brush: js;">{
   "folders":
   [
      {
         "path": "/home/me/code/python/my-project"
      }
   ]
}</pre>

			<p>
				The above is what a typical project file looks like. One cool feature about Sublime is how 
				easy it is to add custom settings to any project. This is done by adding a <em>settings</em>
				key and adding whatever you wish. To add custom patterns at a project-level you will need
				to first add a <em>settings</em> key that contains another dictionary called <em>sublime-debugkiller</em>.
				Under that should be a key named <em>patterns</em> that is a list (array) of patterns, much like
				those found in the global settings file. Here's a sample based on our imaginary debug method
				named <strong>debugMe()</strong>.
			</p>

<pre class="brush: js; highlight: [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19]">{
   "folders":
   [
      {
         "path": "/home/me/code/python/my-project"
      }
   ],
   "settings": {
      "sublime-debugkiller": {
         "patterns": [
            {
               "pattern": "debugMe\\s(.*?)",
               "scopes": [
                  "source.python"
               ]
            }
         ]
      }
   }
}</pre>

			<p>
				Now, when working in this project and you press the key sequence to
				activate Debug Killer this pattern will be added to the global list.
				If the file being examined is a Python file it will find all instances
				of the <strong>debugMe()</strong> method call.
